# Java Web Development Project

This is a Java/web development project where I decided to create a fictional video game store. 
My main focus with this project is learning how to put everything together, how to set up a back-end, and develop a fully working web application.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   git clone <REPO_URL>

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>

3. **Set-up**  
   This project uses Node.js and Express.js, which you will need to install.
   Make sure you installed Node on your machine. Then type this in your terminal:
   npm install

5. **Start the Server**  
   Start the server using Node.js, by typing this in your terminal: node server.js

6. **View in Browser**  
    Once running, you can access the application in your browser at this URL: http://localhost:3000`
